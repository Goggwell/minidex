# Minidex

A miniature PokeDex built with vanilla JavaScript and Sass, using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co).

Search for 800+ Pokemon and get detailed information on each one!

## Installation

Clone this repository

```bash
mkdir minidex
cd minidex
git clone https://github.com/Goggwell/minidex.git
```
If using VSCode, launch site with the Live Server extension.
Otherwise, you can run the following:
```bash
# uses localhost:3000
yarn watch
```
Makes use of gulp and browser-sync.
## To-Do
Use a front-end framework (i.e. React) to better organize code:
- Separate Minidex components (cleaner code + more efficient/less lag)
- Easier for adding more building blocks (in case I want to add new features)

Add Winbox.js for special popups (related to evolutions, moveset etc.)
